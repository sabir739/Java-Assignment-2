📘 Calculator Application Using Method Overloading

Assignment – 02 | Java Programming | Semester 3

📍 Project Overview

This project is a simple Calculator Application implemented in Java to demonstrate the concept of method overloading.
The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, implemented using multiple overloaded methods.

This assignment is part of the Java Programming course offered by School of Engineering & Technology (SOET) for the academic session 2025–26.

🎯 Objectives

Understand and apply method overloading in Java

Implement arithmetic operations with different parameter types

Use Java input handling and control structures

Handle runtime exceptions (e.g., divide-by-zero)

Build a simple, interactive menu-driven program

Learn basic GitHub usage for code submission

✅ Features

Multiple overloaded methods for addition (int, double, multiple parameters)

Subtraction, multiplication, and division operations

Exception handling for invalid inputs and divide-by-zero

Clean, interactive menu-driven UI

Modular code structure following OOP principles

📌 Method Overloading Used

The Calculator class includes the following overloaded methods:

add(int a, int b)
add(double a, double b)
add(int a, int b, int c)
subtract(int a, int b)
multiply(double a, double b)
divide(int a, int b)

🧮 Sample Output
Welcome to the Calculator Application!
1. Add Numbers
2. Subtract Numbers
3. Multiply Numbers
4. Divide Numbers
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 1

Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 20
Result: 30
